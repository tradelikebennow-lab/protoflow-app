## Overview
This is a functional high-fidelity prototype consisting of 1 interconnected screens. The code is built with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS.

## Navigation Logic (IMPORTANT)
- Navigation is NOT handled via standard `<a href>` tags.
- It uses a declarative attribute: `data-goto="TARGET_PAGE_ID"`.
- A JavaScript shim handles click events on these elements and redirects to `{PAGE_ID}.html`.
- When extending this project, maintain this pattern or refactor all `data-goto` attributes to standard links.

## Screen Topology

### [p1] Interactive Correlation Matrix Dashboard
- **Filename**: `p1.html`
- **Description**: A comprehensive single-page dashboard featuring a high-density correlation heatmap. The header contains a toggle for 'Light' and 'Dark' themes and a timeframe switcher for 'Daily' and '4 Hour' data sets. The main interface consists of a symmetrical grid matrix where both the X and Y axes are populated with the provided symbol list (USD/CAD, USD/CHF, S&P 500, Gold, etc.). Each intersection cell displays a correlation coefficient ranging from -1.00 to +1.00, color-coded for instant visual analysis: vibrant green for high positive correlation, deep red for high negative correlation, and neutral grey for weak correlations. Hovering over any cell highlights the corresponding row and column for easy tracking across the large dataset.
- **Outgoing Connections**:
  - links to -> `dashboard_main` (Unknown)
  - links to -> `export_dialog` (Unknown)
  - links to -> `anomaly_explorer` (Unknown)
