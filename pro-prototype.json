      "description": "A comprehensive single-page dashboard featuring a high-density correlation heatmap. The header contains a toggle for 'Light' and 'Dark' themes and a timeframe switcher for 'Daily' and '4 Hour' data sets. The main interface consists of a symmetrical grid matrix where both the X and Y axes are populated with the provided symbol list (USD/CAD, USD/CHF, S&P 500, Gold, etc.). Each intersection cell displays a correlation coefficient ranging from -1.00 to +1.00, color-coded for instant visual analysis: vibrant green for high positive correlation, deep red for high negative correlation, and neutral grey for weak correlations. Hovering over any cell highlights the corresponding row and column for easy tracking across the large dataset.",
